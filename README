BRAHMA - Privilege elevation exploit for the Nintendo 3DS.

This privilege elevation exploit is based on reverse engineered code
of a publicly available, commercial exploit. With existing user mode
code execution privileges (e.g. Ninjhax), it can be used to further
elevate privileges to ARM9 pre-kernel.

Credits:
- To 3dbrew.org and all its contributors for being such a great resource
- To whomever initially found the vulnerabilities and wrote the publicly
  available exploit code
- To everybody who's been working on porting this exploit its various
  "bootstrap" branches to newer firmware versions and improving its stability
  (in particular yifanlu, yuriks and shinyquagsire23)
- To everybody involved in creating libctru, Ninjhax and the Homebrew Menu

How to build:
- Install and configure devkitarm
  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/)
- Open a shell and run make
- Prebuilt binary releases are available at
  https://github.com/patois/Brahma/releases
  
How to use:
- Run the resulting brahma.3dsx (from Homebrew Menu) 
- By default, the exploit will attempt to gain ARM11 kernel privileges before
  finally gaining ARM9 pre-kernel privileges (by performing a "firmlaunch").
  
  The built-in ARM9 payload delays normal execution before it eventually
  reboots into the stock / sysnand firmware. This default payload serves
  demonstration purposes only. The standard proof-of-concept payload may be
  replaced by putting the file 'arm9payload.bin' into the root folder of your
  SD-card. This file must consist of valid ARM9 executable code that will be
  mapped to physical address 0x23F00000 during run-time. Its code should begin
  with a branch instruction at offset 0 and a 'placeholder' for a u32
  variable at offset 4, which will be filled by the exploit with a backup of
  the original ARM9 entry point of the FIRM header during runtime.
  
  The 'bootstrap' branch of archshift's Decrypt9 tool is one example of an
  ARM9 payload that can be launched using this exploit (build using 'make',
  rename the resulting .bin file to arm9payload.bin and place it into the root
  folder of your SD card). Decrypt9 for bootstrap can be downloaded from
  https://github.com/archshift/Decrypt9/tree/bootstrap
