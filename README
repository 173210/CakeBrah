Privilege elevation exploit for the New Nintendo 3DS.

This privilege elevation exploit is based on reverse engineered code
of a publicly available, commercial exploit. With existing user mode
code execution privileges (e.g. Ninjhax), it can be used to further
elevate privileges to ARM9 pre-kernel.

Currently supported / tested:
- N3DS XL, FW 9.0.0.20E

Credits:
- To 3dbrew.org for being such a great resource
- To whomever initially found the vulnerabilities and wrote the publicly
  available exploit code
- To everybody who's been working on porting this exploit to newer firmware
  versions

How to build:
- Install and configure devkitarm
  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/)
- Open a shell and run make

How to use:
- Run the resulting bootstrap.3dsx (from Homebrew Menu) 
- By default, the exploit will attempt to gain ARM11 kernel privileges before
  finally gaining ARM9 pre-kernel privileges (by performing a "firmlaunch").
  The ARM9 code that is run by the exploit delays normal execution before it
  eventually resumes loading the stock firmware. This default payload serves
  demonstration purposes only. The standard proof-of-concept payload may be
  replaced by putting the file 'arm9payload.bin' into the root folder of your
  SD-card. This file must consist of valid ARM9 executable code that will be
  mapped to physical address 0x23F00000 during run-time. The code should begin
  with a branch instruction at offset 0 and a 'placeholder' for a u32
  variable at offset 4, which will be filled by the exploit with a backup of
  the original ARM9 entry point of the FIRM header during runtime.
  The 'bootstrap' branch of archshift's Decrypt9 tool is one example of an
  ARM9 payload that can be launched using this exploit. You can get it at:
